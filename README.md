# Gain insights from historical location data using Amazon Location Service and AWS analytics services #

## Overview ##

Many organizations around the world rely on the use of physical assets, such as vehicles, to deliver a service to their end-customers. By tracking these assets in real time and storing the results, asset owners can derive valuable insights on how their assets are being used to continuously deliver business improvements and plan for future changes. For example, a delivery company operating a fleet of vehicles may need to ascertain the impact from local policy changes outside of their control, such as the announced expansion of an [Ultra-Low Emission Zone (ULEZ)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_Low_Emission_Zone). By combining historical vehicle location data with information from other sources, the company can devise empirical approaches for better decision-making. For example, the companyâ€™s procurement team can use this information to make decisions about which vehicles to prioritize for replacement before policy changes go into effect.

Developers can use the support in [Amazon Location Service](https://aws.amazon.com/location/) for [publishing device position updates to Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/07/amazon-location-service-device-updates-eventbridge/) to build a near-real-time data pipeline that stores locations of tracked assets in [Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). Additionally, you can use [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) to enrich incoming location data with data from other sources, such as an [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) table containing vehicle maintenance details. Then a data analyst can use the [geospatial querying capabilities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/querying-geospatial-data.html) of [Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/) to gain insights, such as the number of days their vehicles have operated in the proposed boundaries of an expanded ULEZ. Because vehicles that do not meet ULEZ emissions standards are subjected to a daily charge to operate within the zone, you can use the location data, along with maintenance data such as age of the vehicle, current mileage, and current emissions standards to estimate the amount the company would have to spend on daily fees.

This post shows how you can use Amazon Location, EventBridge, Lambda, [Amazon Data Firehose](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/), and Amazon S3 to build a location-aware data pipeline, and use this data to drive meaningful insights using [AWS Glue](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/) and Athena.

## Walkthrough ##

### Prerequisites ###

For this walkthrough, you will need the following prerequisites in place:

* An AWS account
* [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) permissions to deploy the AWS resources using [AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/)
* Local installation of the latest version of [AWS SAM Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html)
* Local installation of [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/) and [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)

### Deploying the solution ###

* Follow the steps in the [official documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html) to install the latest release of the AWS SAM CLI for your operating system
* Once successfully installed, run `sam --version` to return the AWS SAM CLI version

> Note: The AWS SAM CLI requires appropriate permissions to provision resources in the chosen AWS account. Ensure that [access key and secret access keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/prerequisites.html) have been created using IAM, and that aws configure has been used to register them locally on your machine.

1. To download all required files to your local machine, run the following command.

```
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-location-service-data-analytics
```

2. Navigate to the `sam` directory.

```
cd sam
```

3. Build the SAM application. 

```
sam build
```

4. Confirm that the `Build Succeeded` message is displayed.

5. Deploy the application.

```
sam deploy --guided
```

6. When prompted, enter the unique details chosen for your environment. In this example, we have chosen the CloudFormation stack name `locationAnalytics` and kept the remainder of the options as defaults. CloudFormation parameter `SimulationIntervalMinutes` is the frequency with which simulated device location updates take place (by default, this is every 15 minutes).

```
Stack Name []:locationAnalytics
AWS Region [eu-west-1]:
Parameter LambdaS3Prefix [device-position/lambda]:
Parameter FirehoseS3Prefix [device-position/firehose]:
Parameter SimulationIntervalMinutes [15]:
```

Deployment options are explained below:

7. Confirm that the `Successfully created/updated stack` message is shown. Deployment will take approximately 5 minutes.

8. You are now ready to test the solution.

### Cleaning up ###
To avoid incurring future charges, delete the CloudFormation stacks that have been provisioned in the AWS account. This can be achieved using:

```
sam delete
```

You will be required to empty the S3 bucket before the template can be deleted. The S3 bucket used for location data can be found in the CloudFormation output `LocationDataS3Bucket`.
